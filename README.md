# Simple-Multiplayer-Prototype
This is a simple Godot game that supports LAN Multiplayer. It's a prototype for future games and it's good to have a valid version control of it.<br>
I got this project running with the help from a tutorial made by <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/@curtjs-dev">curtjs</a>, and I further developed it myself to it's final form.
